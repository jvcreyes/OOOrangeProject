 Axie Infinity Tokens Converter



Axie Infinity is a game that allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade creatures known as 'Axies' which are digitized NFT's (Non-Fungible Token). The game is categorized as a 'play-to-earn' genre where players can earn tokens that can be traded on Binance as an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency. For more info on Axie Infinity, visit: https://axieinfinity.com/. This app focuses on the conversion of Axie Infinity Tokens namely: Ethereum(ETH), Axie Infinity Shard(AXS), and SLP(Smooth Love Potion) into fiat currencies. It will be a useful app for easily converting tokens to fiat currencies.



Features:
- Conversion of Fiat Currencies.
- Conversion of Smooth Love Potion(SLP) into any known fiat currency.
- Conversion of Ethereum(ETH) into any known fiat currency.
- Conversion of Axie Infinity Shard(AXS) into any known fiat currency.

Conversion Process

	The conversion is rather simple, the user inputs the desired coin to convert from (choices would be from AXS, SLP, ETH or Fiat Currency) and to (Fiat Currency)
	the program then proceeds to convert the desired coin by getting the real time value of both coins from the internet with the help of API and uses simple math for the conversion. 

	For example, we would be converting 150 SLP into PHP (assuming user input is :CONVERT SLP: and :CONVERT INTO PHP:):
	User Input = 150 SLP
	SLP Real Time Value in PHP = 3.44 PHP

	SLP Value as of November 3, 2021, 1:08 PM PH standard time = 3.44 PHP per SLP [data from https://www.coingecko.com]

	Output = (User Input) * (SLP Real Time Value in PHP)
	Output = 516.00 PHP
